  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In the case that you are a researcher heavily creating data and depositing it in a repository, please, indicate the repositories you are using and which you will subsequently describe. If you are a repository manager describe your repository. Local as well domain or central repositories are in use, often these are just local servers with discs that are managed by a data manager. Please, also specify a PID that points to that repository. F4 applies: (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource. Examples for repositories are: local (can be many), domain (can be many), generic (B2SAFE, B2SHARE, B2DROP, ZENODO, GITHUB, Dropbox, FIGSHARE, etc.)"@en;
